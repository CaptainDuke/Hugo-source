# Biography

I will be a postgraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [The University of Hong Kong][4] in Sept. 2018. Currently I am an intern at [AI-Lab, Tencent][1], with [Dr. Wenhan Luo][5] on developing deep learning models for face-liveness detection and its anti-spoofing technics from wild videos. 

Before coming here, I was a research assistant at [South China University of Technology][2], working with [Prof. Yong Xu][6] and [Associate Prof. Haibin Ling][7]. We were mainly focusing on human action recognition in static images and dynamic videos, using the combination model of CNNs and LSTMs. 

During undergraduate years, I went to [Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey][3] with scholarships for Student Research Summer Program, where I engaged in Auto-Navigation Robotics projects. I got my BEng. at South China University of Technology in 2017. For more information, please see my [Curriculum Vitae].
