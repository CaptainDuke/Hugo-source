summary = " Developed a self-driving auto-navigation car rotbot. The robot was equippted with a scanner-camera, which could scan scenes 30 times every second. We did many interesting sub-projects, including distance detection, path-planning, etc. The whole project was developted based on Raspberry Pi system, and we programmed in Python, calling OpenCV Api."
